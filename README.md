# Library-Management
The Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to simplify and automate essential library operations. It provides a user-friendly interface to efficiently manage books and related information. This system allows librarians or users to add, search, update, and delete book records with ease, ensuring smooth handling of library data.

The project uses Python’s data handling capabilities to store and manipulate book details such as Book ID, Title, Author, Genre, and Availability Status. Each function is designed to perform a specific task:

Add Book: Allows the user to insert a new book’s details into the system.

Search Book: Enables quick lookup of books by ID, title, or author, making it easier to locate information.

Update Book: Modifies existing book records, such as editing the title, author name, or availability status.

Delete Book: Removes outdated or unwanted book records from the system.

The system is structured, fast, and reliable, making it an ideal solution for maintaining library data in an organized manner. It can be easily extended to support features like data storage using files or databases, issuing books, returning books, or generating reports.
